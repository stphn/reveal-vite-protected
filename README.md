Building Html Presentations with [Reveal.js](https://revealjs.com/) and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/).
I will assume you have some familiarity with Node.js and have it at least version 8.3 installed.

## Script dependency

[Staticrypt](https://github.com/robinmoisson/staticrypt) uses AES-256 to encrypt your string with your passphrase in your browser (client side).
